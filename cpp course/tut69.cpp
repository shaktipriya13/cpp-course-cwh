//STL is library of generic classes and fxns

//components of STL -> containers, algorithms and iterators-->they all 3 work in complete coordination with each other

//1. container is an object that stores data...these containers use template classes...so we can easily customize these containers

//2. algorithms- some set of procedure which u can use to manipulate data and arrive at a procedure...eg. searching sorting algos use template fxns

//STL is used bcoz it is not a good idea to reinvent the wheel(i.e. writing the same code again and again with different datatypes)
//product based companies give more importance to dsa

//3. iterators are objects that point to an element in the container...iterators are objects but act as pointers...
// iterators connects algorithms with the containers
//the iterator moves as instructed by the algorithm
//STL helps you reuse these well tested classes and functions umpteenth (large number of times)number of times according to your own convenience.
