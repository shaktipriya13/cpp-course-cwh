/*
Pure Virtual Functions in C++
Pure virtual function is a function that doesnâ€™t perform any operation and the function is declared by assigning the value 0 to it. Pure virtual functions are declared in abstract classes.


Abstract Base Class in C++
Abstract base class is a class that has at least one pure virtual function in its body. The classes which are inheriting the base class must need to override the virtual function of the abstract class otherwise compiler will throw an error.

an instance of an abstract class cannot be created buttttttt........We can have pointers or references of abstract classes.

//pure virtual fxn--->ek aisa virtual fxn jiska nya version apko derived class me banana hi pade...usko ovveride krna compulsory ha
//pure virtual fxns are used to make abstract base class
//an abstract class is a class which has atleast 1 pure virtual fxn

//an abstract base class cannot be used to create objects...it is designed so that it can be inherited onto new classes...those new classes can be then used to create new objects

//NOTE::::If we don't override the pure virtual function in derived class, then derived class also becomes abstract class.
