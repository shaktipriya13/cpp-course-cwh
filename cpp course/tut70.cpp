/*
STL= containers + algos + iterators
containers- objects which stores data
algos- procedure to process data
iterators- object which points to an element of the container

types of conatiners-3:
1. Sequence containers -> stores data in linear fashion
        eg: vector, list, dequeue(double ended queue)
2. Associative containers
        -->they are designed so that we can have direct access of the elements,used for fast searching, fast deletion...but the access becomes a bit slow as random access cannot be done
        -->they store data in tree like structure
        eg. map,multimap(does work of dictionary) ,while set, multiset (does work of set)

3. Derived containers
            -->they can be derived from sequence and associative conatainers..they are used to do real-world modelling
            -->eg. stack(Lifo), queue(fifo), priority-queue
