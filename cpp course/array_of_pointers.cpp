An array of pointers in C++ is an array where each element is a pointer. This means that each element of the array holds the memory address of another variable or object.

Arrays of pointers are useful for various scenarios, such as:

Managing arrays of dynamically allocated memory.
Storing addresses of objects for efficient access and manipulation.
Handling arrays of data structures or objects in more complex applications.

code:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 20, c = 30;

    // Array of pointers to integers
    int* ptrArr[] = {&a, &b, &c};

    // Accessing elements through pointers
    cout << "Values accessed through pointers:" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
        cout << "Element " << i << ": " << *(ptrArr[i]) << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
