The ternary operator, represented by `? :`, is a conditional operator in C++ that evaluates a condition and returns one of two expressions based on the result of that condition.

### Syntax:
```cpp
condition ? expression1 : expression2;
```

### How It Works:
- `condition` is evaluated first. If it's true (non-zero), `expression1` is executed; otherwise, `expression2` is executed.
- It's a concise way to express simple if-else logic in a single line.

### Example:
```cpp


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x = 10;
    int y = 20;

    int maxNum = (x > y) ? x : y;
    cout << "The maximum number is: " << maxNum << endl;

    return 0;
}


```

In this example:
- `(x > y) ? x : y;` checks if `x` is greater than `y`.
- If the condition is true, it assigns `x` to `maxNum`; otherwise, it assigns `y` to `maxNum`.
- It's functionally equivalent to:
  ```cpp
  int maxNum;
  if (x > y) {
      maxNum = x;
  } else {
      maxNum = y;
  }
  ```

### Notes:
- The expressions `expression1` and `expression2` must have compatible types, or implicit type conversions might occur.
- Avoid using overly complex expressions within the ternary operator for the sake of readability.
- It's a useful tool for concise conditional assignments, but excessive nesting or complexity can reduce code clarity.
