// In simple terms, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++ is a way of writing code that focuses on creating "objects" that have both data and functions associated with them. These objects represent real-world entities, like a car, a person, or a bank account.

// Here's a breakdown of some key concepts in OOP:

// Class: A class is like a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (data members) and behaviors (member functions or methods) that objects of that class will have.

// Object: An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity created based on the blueprint provided by the class. Each object has its own set of data and can perform actions based on its defined behaviors.

// Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes or properties) and methods (functions or behaviors) that operate on that data within a single unit, typically a class. It helps in hiding the internal implementation details of a class from the outside world and only exposing the necessary interface.

// Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism by which one class can inherit properties and behaviors from another class. It allows for the creation of a hierarchy of classes, where subclasses (derived classes) can reuse and extend the functionality of a superclass (base class).

// Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of objects to take on multiple forms. In C++, polymorphism is achieved through function overloading and function overriding. Function overloading allows functions with the same name but different parameters to be defined within a class, while function overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

// Overall, OOP in C++ provides a way to organize and structure code in a more intuitive(easy to understand) and modular manner, making it easier to manage and maintain large-scale software projects.
