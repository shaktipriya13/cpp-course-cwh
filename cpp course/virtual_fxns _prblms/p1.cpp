(A) Virtual functions are functions that can be overridden in derived class with the same signature.
(B) Virtual functions enable run-time polymorphism in a inheritance hierarchy.
(C) If a function is ‘virtual’ in the base class, the most-derived class’s implementation of the function is called according to the actual type of the object referred to, regardless of the declared type of the pointer or reference.
