Certainly! Here's a breakdown of potential coding-related questions that could be asked in a placement exam for each topic in C++:

### 1. **Basics of C++**
   - **Syntax and Basics**
     - Questions on basic programs involving variables, loops, conditional statements.

   - **Input/Output Streams**
     - Implementing programs using `cin`, `cout` for input/output handling.
     - Formatting output using `printf`, `scanf`.

   - **Memory Management**
     - Implementing programs utilizing pointers, dynamic memory allocation (`new` and `delete`).

   - **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
     - Implementing classes, inheritance, polymorphism in scenarios like shapes, vehicles, etc.
     - Programs using constructors, destructors.

### 2. **Advanced C++ Concepts**
   - **Templates**
     - Implementing generic functions/classes using templates.
   
   - **STL (Standard Template Library)**
     - Solving problems using STL containers (Vectors, Maps, Sets) and algorithms (Sorting, Searching).
   
   - **Exception Handling**
     - Writing programs using try-catch blocks for error handling.

   - **File Handling**
     - Reading and writing files, handling file streams.

### 3. **Concurrency in C++**
   - **Threads**
     - Implementing simple multithreading scenarios using `std::thread`.
   
   - **Mutexes and Locks**
     - Solving concurrency issues using mutexes and locks.
   
   - **Atomic Operations**
     - Implementing atomic operations to ensure thread safety.

### 4. **Best Practices and Advanced Concepts**
   - **Memory Management Techniques**
     - Implementing RAII principles, using smart pointers in specific scenarios.

   - **Performance Optimization**
     - Code optimization techniques, understanding when to use `const` correctness, move semantics.

   - **Design Patterns**
     - Solving problems using Singleton, Factory, Observer patterns, etc.

   - **Debugging and Testing**
     - Identifying and fixing issues in code snippets, writing unit tests for given functions.

### 5. **Understanding C++ Standards**
   - **C++ Versions**
     - Understanding and utilizing features introduced in newer C++ standards.
   
### 6. **Tools and IDEs**
   - **IDE Familiarity**
     - Solving problems or writing code within a given IDE environment.

   - **Build Systems**
     - Understanding basic CMake or Makefile structure, interpreting build output.

   - **Version Control Systems**
     - Basic Git commands, understanding repository structure.

These topics cover a wide range of potential questions that could be asked in a coding-based placement exam for a B.Tech student focusing on C++ concepts. Practice coding problems related to these topics, understand their implementations, and be prepared to solve problems efficiently within a given time frame.\
